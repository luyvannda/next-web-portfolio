## Overview

This is a web portfolio designed with next.js, tailwind.css, and typescript.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- View transition animation when switching between pages
- View auto swiping motion when visit my-skills page
- Flip every project cards with mouse click or touch in my-projects page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Framer Motion
- Swiper
- React Hook Form with Zod validation

### What I learned

In this project, I gained proficiency in using Next.js for image optimization, server-side rendering, and routing. Additionally, I learned to employ TypeScript for prop type validation, catching code errors before runtime. The project heavily relies on Tailwind CSS to create responsive designs across various screen devices. Furthermore, I explored valuable animation techniques with the assistance of Framer Motion and Swiper. Lastly, I acquired the skill to create a contact form using React Hook Form with Zod validation.

### Continued development

While this web application boasts a robust and completed front-end, there are still a few limitations. The back-end needs to handle data from users when they interact with the contact form and send an auto-reply email to the user once the form is submitted. I plan to implement these features at a later date when I am more proficient with databases and Next.js.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to WebChain Dev for video tutorial on how to build Next.js 14 Portfolio with tailwind css and typescript. My web portfolio is inspired from his but not exactly the same. I spent considerably long hours to make the portfolio unique to my taste and responsive with tailwinds on my own.
