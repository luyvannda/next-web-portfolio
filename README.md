## Overview

This is a web portfolio designed with tailwind.css, react, next.js and typescript.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- View transition animation when switching between pages
- View auto swiping motion when visit my-skills page
- Flip every project cards with mouse click or touch in my-projects page

## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Framer Motion
- Swiper

### What I learned

In this project, I have learned to use next.js for image optimization, server side rendering and routing. I also use typescript to make type validation and catching code errors before runtime. I also learned to use Tailwind to create responsive design for all screen devices. Additionally, I also learned some useful animation techniques with the help of Framer Motion and Swiper.

### Continued development

As you can see, there is a few limitation to this web application, the front-end is robust and completed, yet the back-end still need to handle data from users when they interact with the contact form. I hope to implement this in later date when I am more proficient with database and next.js.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to WebChain Dev for video tutorial on how to build Next.js 14 Portfolio with tailwind css and typescript. My web portfolio is inspired from his but not exactly the same. I spent considerably long hours to make the site responsive using tailwinds on my own, because his final production build does not pay much attention to responsive web design.
